-- SYMMETRIC TREE --
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true

-- MAXIMUM DEPTH OF BINARY TREE --

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

-- Validate Binary Search Tree --
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

--- Range Sum of BST ---

Given the root node of a binary search tree and two integers low and high,
return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range [low, high].
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32
Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.

 Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
 Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values.
  (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

  Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
  Output: [[3],[9,20],[15,7]]

  Input: root = [1]
  Output: [[1]]

  Input: root = []
  Output: []

Binary tree right side view

Given the root of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the right side of it,
return the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom.
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
Output: [1,3,4]
